This was really just a coding bootcamp challenge, but it definitely works so I won't stop you from using it.\n\nTo create a new note, simply click the + icon in the upper-right corner. Once you've entered a title and some content, a save icon will appear next to the + icon. Click that to save your note.\n\nYour saved notes will appear in that list on the left. Click on a note to read it, or click on its red trash bin icon to delete it.\n\nNB: Editing notes not supported."
